# üêú Curiosity-Diffuser: Curiosity Guide Diffusion Models for Reliability

<p align="center">

Curiosity-Diffuser is an novel guided diffusion model with anti-curiosity for decision making, thereby improving the reliability of the policy. The core idea is to use a Random Network Distillation (RND) curiosity module to assess whether the model's behavior aligns with the training data, and then minimize curiosity by classifier guidance diffusion to reduce overgeneralization during inference. Additionally, we propose a computationally efficient metric for evaluating the reliability of the policy, measuring the similarity between the generated behaviors and the training dataset, to facilitate research about reliability learning.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

#### 1. Create and activate conda environment
```bash
$ conda create -n cleandiffuser python==3.9
$ conda activate cleandiffuser
```
#### 2. Install PyTorch
Install `torch>1.0.0,<2.3.0` that is compatible with your CUDA version. For example, `PyTorch 2.2.2` with `CUDA 12.1`:
```bash
$ conda install pytorch==2.2.2 torchvision==0.17.2 pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```
#### 3. Install CleanDiffuser from source
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/CleanDiffuserTeam/CleanDiffuser.git
$ cd CleanDiffuser
$ pip install -e .
```
#### 4. Additional installations
For users who need to run `pipelines` and reproduce the results of the paper, they will need to install RL simulators.

First, install the dependencies related to the mujoco-py environment. For more details, see https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py#install-mujoco

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install libosmesa6-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libglfw3 libglew-dev patchelf
```
```bash
# Install D4RL from source (recommended)
$ cd <PATH_TO_D4RL_INSTALL_DIR>
$ git clone https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/D4RL.git
$ cd D4RL
$ pip install -e .
```

Try it now!   
```bash
# Reinforcement Learning
$ python pipelines/diffuser_d4rl_mujoco.py

```

KEY POINT: the coefficient of rnd need to be set in `cleandiffuser/classifier/rnd_classifier.py`. In AntMaze Env, the coefficient is set to 10~100. 
In halfcheetah, the coefficient is set to 1e4~1e5. In hopper and walker, the coefficient is set to 1e3~1e4.

<!-- TUTORIALS -->
## üç∑ Tutorials

We will make every effort to provide detailed `tutorials` for beginners in the field of **Diffusion Models in Decision Making**, which is also beneficial for learning the core components of CleanDiffuser and expanding them into new algorithms. **Our vision is not only to offer a benchmark for the community but more importantly, to enable everyone to implement and innovate diffusion algorithms more easily based on CleanDiffuser.**  

> **Note:** In the `tutorials`, we generally only explain and demonstrate individual mechanisms or components, rather than a complete algorithm, and therefore ignore the extra tricks and take just a few minutes of training time. This may cause performance drop, which is normal!

We have now provided the following tutorials and are continuously updating more:

```bash
# Build the DiffusionBC algorithm with minimal code
python tutorials/1_a_minimal_DBC_implementation.py
# Customize classifier-free guidance
python tutorials/2_classifier-free_guidance.py
# Customize classifier guidance
python tutorials/3_classifier_guidance.py
# Customize diffusion network backbone
python tutorials/4_customize_your_diffusion_network_backbone.py

# Special. Consistency Policies
python tutorials/sp_consistency_policy.py 

```

If you wish to reproduce the results of the paper perfectly, we recommend using the full implementation in `pipelines`.
